          <p class="game-instruct">Select any letter between a-z one at a time to guess the letters that make up the word.  Correctly guessed letters
            will unhide the letter and you will hear the sound of a hit.  Incorrect guesses will result in loss of a guess as well as you will hear a "strike"
            sound.  Using up all your avialable guesses before you uncover the word will result in a game loss and you will hear the "You're Out".  Uncovering
            all the letters before getting out will result in you winning the round and you will hear the crowd roar.  Good luck and have fun.
